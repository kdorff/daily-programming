 * Reddit Daily Programmer, 191 Intermediate
 * @author Kevin Dorff
 * http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2o5tb7/2014123_challenge_191_intermediate_space_probe/
 *
 * Description:
 * --------------------------
 * NASA has contracted you to program the AI of a new probe. This new 
 * probe must navigate space from a starting location to an end location. 
 * The probe will have to deal with Asteroids and Gravity Wells. Hopefully 
 * it can find the shortest path.
 * 
 * Map and Path:
 * --------------------------
 * This challenge requires you to establish a random map for the challenge. 
 * Then you must navigate a probe from a starting location to an end location.
 * 
 * Map:
 * --------------------------
 * You are given N -- you generate a NxN 2-D map (yes space is 3-D but for 
 * this challenge we are working in 2-D space)
 * 30% of the spots are "A" asteroids
 * 10% of the spots are "G" gravity wells (explained below)
 * 60% of the spots are "." empty space.
 * When you generate the map you must figure out how many of each spaces is 
 * needed to fill the map. The map must then be randomly populated to hold 
 * the amount of Gravity Wells and Asteroids based on N and the above 
 * percentages.
 * 
 * N and Obstacles
 * --------------------------
 * As n changes so does the design of your random space map. Truncate the 
 * amount of obstacles and its always a min size of 1. (So say N is 11 so 
 * 121 spaces. At 10% for wells you need 12.1 or just 12 spots) N can be 
 * between 2 and 1000. To keep it simple you will assume every space is 
 * empty then populate the random Asteroids and Gravity wells (no need 
 * to compute the number of empty spaces - they will just be the ones 
 * not holding a gravity well or asteroid)
 * 
 * Asteroids
 * --------------------------
 * Probes cannot enter the space of an Asteroid. It will just be destroyed.
 * 
 * Empty Spaces
 * --------------------------
 * Probes can safely cross space by the empty spaces of space. Beware 
 * of gravity wells as described below.
 * 
 * Gravity Wells
 * --------------------------
 * Gravity wells are interesting. The Space itself is so dense it cannot 
 * be travelled in. The adjacent spaces of a Gravity well are too strong 
 * and cannot be travelled in. Therefore you might see this.
 * . = empty space, G = gravity well
 *  .....
 *  .....
 *  ..G..
 *  .....
 *  .....
 * But due to the gravity you cannot pass (X = unsafe)
 *  .....
 *  .XXX.
 *  .XGX.
 *  .XXX.
 *  .....
 * You might get Gravity wells next to each other. They do not effect each 
 * other but keep in mind the area around them will not be safe to travel in.
 *  ......
 *  .XXXX.
 *  .XGGX.
 *  .XXXX.
 *  ......
 * Probe Movement:
 * --------------------------
 * Probes can move 8 directions. Up, down, left, right or any of the 4 
 * adjacent corners. However there is no map wrapping. Say you are at 
 * the top of the map you cannot move up to appear on the bottom of 
 * the map. Probes cannot fold space. And for whatever reason we are 
 * contained to only the spots on the map even thou space is infinite
 * in any direction.
 * 
 * Output:
 * --------------------------
 * Must show the final Map and shortest safe route on the map.
 * . = empty space
 * S = start location
 * E = end location
 * G = gravity well
 * A = Asteroid
 * O = Path.
 * If you fail to get to the end because of no valid path you must travel 
 * as far as you can and show the path. Note that the probe path was 
 * terminated early due to "No Complete Path" error.
 * 
 * Challenge Input:
 * --------------------------
 * using (row, col) for coordinates in space.
 * Find solutions for:
 * N = 10, start = (0,0) end = (9,9)
 * N = 10, start = (9, 0) end = (0, 9)
 * N= 50, start = (0,0) end = (49, 49)
 * 
 * Map Obstacle %
 * --------------------------
 * I generated a bunch of maps and due to randomness you will get easy 
 * ones or hard ones. I suggest running your solutions many times to see 
 * your outcomes. If you find the solution is always very straight then 
 * I would increase your asteroid and gravity well percentages. Or if 
 * you never get a good route then decrease the obstacle percentages.
 *
 * TODO
 * --------------------------
 * * Add gravity well spaces and asteroid spaces to skipPositions to
 *   optimize openPaths()
 * * It's possible I'm not always returning optimal. Might be worth
 *   investigating, maybe one of my optimizations is too agressive?
