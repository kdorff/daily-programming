/**
 * Wednesday's challenge was released later than I wanted it to be 
 * (my fault entirely), so I'll make it up to you by posting this one 
 * early. I fear some previous hard challenges have appeared unapproachable 
 * to some people due to their logical or mathematical complexity. I aim to 
 * make a Hard challenge today which is innately simple, but will still 
 * require a Hard degree of thought (assuming you come up with the algorithm 
 * yourself.)
 *
 * Take this grid of characters:
 *
 * v<^><>>v><>^<>vvv^^>
 * >^<>^<<v<>>^v^v><^<<
 * v^^>>>>>><v^^<^vvv>v
 * ^^><v<^^<^<^^>>>v>v>
 * ^<>vv^><>^<^^<<^^><v
 * ^vv<<<><>>>>^<>^^^v^
 * ^<^^<^>v<v^<>vv<^v<>
 * v<>^vv<^>vv>v><v^>^^
 * >v<v><^><<v>^^>>^<>^
 * ^v<>^<>^>^^^vv^v>>^<
 * v>v^^<>><<<^^><^vvv^
 *
 * Let's imagine they all represent arrows, pointing to a cell next to them. 
 * For example, v points downward, and < points left. Let's also imagine the
 * grid is infinite - ie. a > arrow at the right-hand side will 'wrap around' 
 * and point to the leftmost character on the same row, meaning the board has 
 * no limits. Now, we're going to follow the direction of the arrows. Look at 
 * the top-left cell. It's a v, so it points down to the cell below it, which 
 * is a >. That points to the cell to its right, which is a ^. This points up 
 * to the cell above it, which is a <. This points to the cell to its left... 
 * which is exactly where we started. See how this has formed a 'loop'? You 
 * could go round and round and round forever. Remember, the board wraps 
 * around, so this grid is also a loop:
 *
 * >>>>>>>>>>>>
 *
 * And so is this, if you follow the arrows:
 *
 * ^^>
 * >^^
 * ^>^
 *
 * This looping structure is called a cycle. The discrete mathematicians 
 * in this sub should have all collectively just said 'aha!', as they should 
 * know already be thinking of how to approach the challenge from that last 
 * sentence. If you're not a discrete mathematician, read on. Your challenge 
 * today is simply described: given a grid such as the one above, find the 
 * largest cycle in it.
 *
 * One important point: the 'length' of the cycle is just the part of the
 * cycle that repeats. For example, the cycle is not made longer by adding 
 *
 * an 'intro' to it:
 *
 *     >>v
 *     ^<<
 *      ^
 *      ^
 *      ^
 *      ^
 *
 * The length of this cycle is 6 regardless of where you start from, as
 * that is the length of the 'cycle'.
 *
 * Formal Inputs and Outputs
 *
 * Input Description
 *
 * You will input 2 numbers first - these are the width and height of the
 * grid you'll be working with. Then you will input a grid in the same format 
 * as described above.
 *
 * Output Description
 *
 * You are to output the length of the longest cycle on the grid, possibly 
 * along with some representation of where that cycle is on the board (eg. 
 * print the cycle in another color.)
