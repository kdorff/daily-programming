/**
 * Reddit daily programming for 2014-11-05
 * http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ledaj/11052014_challenge_187_intermediate_finding_time/
 * 
 * Description:
 * I cover the border of my monitor with post it notes with tasks I have to do 
 * during the week. I am very unorganized. Each day I want to find the biggest
 * block of free time to go on to Reddit. But I am not sure when that time is.
 * I am also curious how I spend my days.
 * This challenge you will help me get organized and find that time for
 * me to be on Reddit.
 *
 * Input:
 * I will give you a listing of the post it notes around my monitor. Each line
 * represents a single post it note. Sorry but they are not in any order but I
 * was at least smart enough to date them and put the times of my daily events.
 * 
 * Output:
 * Get me organized. I need to see my schedule for the week. For each day
 * you must find the 1 block of time that is the most time between events
 * on the post its that I can Reddit. Please help maximize my time on Reddit.
 * Assume my start time at work is the beginning of the first event and my 
 * end time at work is the end time of the last event for that day.
 * Then show me my final schedule. And while you are at it show me across the
 * week how many minutes I dedicate to each task with a percentage of time it
 * takes up my time. Hopefully I don't spend most of my time on Reddit.
